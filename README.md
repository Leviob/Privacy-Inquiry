# Privacy-Inquiry
CLI program for searching spending history through Privacy.com.

Privacy.com is a service that allows online purchases to be made without your bank knowing what merchant you are shopping at, and without the merchant knowing your true name, credit card number, or address. 

This program implements the Privacy API and allows me to quickly search through all my transactions made through Privacy and return useful information.
